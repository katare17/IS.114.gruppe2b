        in IT and information systems at the University of Agder. He previously
        holds Master's degrees in multimedia and educational technology, as well
        as theoretical physics. These studies, in combination with work
        experiences such as being a high school teacher, a teaching assistent,
        and mentoring students, Espen has a long and varied background in

      <h2 class="trans" data-lang-id="creative">Creative Figure</h2>
      <p class="trans" data-lang-id="creativeP">
        Part of the course IS-114 - Introduction to co-creation in Information
        Systems, is introduction to programming. For this introduction, the
        programming language Pyret was first used, followed by JavaScript. In
        Pyret, the students made a "creative figure", a composition of which can
        be found on the home page. This figure then had to be recreated in
        JavaScript using both the Canvas API and the Svg API, although it had to
        be done by making functions that mimic those of Pyret. The two JavaScript
        versions are shown below in Figures 1 and 2.

        One of the assignments for the course involved graphical representation
        of the daily energy consumption for an individual. For the assignment
        itself, the data was loaded from a spreadsheet into Pyret where it was
        processed and displayed. Here, we present the data directly from the
        source.
